This is a repository created to keep track of my progress as I do a new start on Competitive Programming as of 2020

## Readings

The summary of any readings that helped me improve my problem-solving skills are gonna be there in `.pdf` format, along with a `.tex` if you want to compile it or modify it yourself.

All credit goes to the ones who made the readings, which are cited at the end of each summary.
