This is a repository created to keep track of my progress as I do a new start on Competitive Programming as of 2020

## Contests

This includes the codes of the of the problems that I managed to solve during a **live** contest, each under its respective directory. If I find out it's allowed, I might also include the `.pdf` file which includes all the problems in the contest.

It's worth noting that I might have included some small comments on the code afterwards just so it is more understandable (and I don't forget how it works).

## Readings

The summary of any readings that helped me improve my problem-solving skills are gonna be there in `.pdf` format, along with a `.tex` if you want to compile it or modify it yourself.

All credit goes to the ones who made the readings, which are cited at the end of each summary.
